Problem description
Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K: Given an array of integers and a positive integer K, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size K using the sliding window technique.

Minimum Window Substring: Given two strings, find the minimum window in the first string that contains all characters of the second string. This is often used for string manipulation with sliding windows.

Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most K distinct characters. This is another common string manipulation problem.

Fruits into Baskets: You have a row of trees, where each tree bears either fruit type 1 or fruit type 2. You are allowed to pick fruits from two adjacent trees, but you cannot pick from more than two types of trees in a row. Find the maximum number of fruits you can collect.

Longest Subarray with Ones After Replacement: Given an array of 0s and 1s, you are allowed to replace at most one 0 with 1. Find the length of the longest subarray of 1s.

Find All Anagrams in a String: Given a string S and a non-empty string P, find all the start indices of P's anagrams in S.

Constrained Subset Sum: Given an array of integers and an integer K, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size K where you can skip at most one element.

Smallest Subarray with a Given Sum: Given an array of positive integers and a target sum, find the length of the smallest contiguous subarray whose sum is at least the target.

Max Consecutive Ones III: Given an array of 0s and 1s and an integer K, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s you can get by flipping at most K 0s to 1s.

Subarray Product Less Than K: Given an array of positive integers and a positive integer K, find the number of contiguous subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is less than K.

Longest Subarray with Equal Number of 0s and 1s: Given an array of 0s and 1s, find the longest subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s.

Maximum Erasure Value: Given an array of positive integers, find the length of the maximum subarray you can get by erasing exactly one element.
